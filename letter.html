  <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

  <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
  <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2023</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2024</li>
    <li>Third semester: 6 May 2024</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
  <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. Of the ideas you submitted, we were most intrigued by the following (in order of priority):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10³ increasing to 3 × 10⁴.)</li>
    <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
  <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. My favourite dances are:</p>

  <h3>Polynesian chicken dance</h3>
  <p>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p>

  <h3>Icelandic brownian shuffle</h3>
  <p>Before the modern interpretation of the Brownian motion was defined, the Icelandic people developed a dance where the performers would shake randomly in one spot for hours — an effect that has been known to induce mild nausea!</p>

  <h3>West African jump style</h3>
  <p>When the beat drops, you drop too... and jump back up again in time with the bassline. These days however, it's mainly performed by people aged 16–25 in closed circles.</p>

  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p>Dr. Eleanor Gaye</p>
